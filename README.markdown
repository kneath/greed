# Greed

Greed is a simple web application written in merb to help you with managing ads across multiple sites.

### Assumptions

Greed is built with some assumptions about how you would like to manage your ads.

1. You want to serve your ads through javascript
2. You only want to run text or image based ads
3. You only want one user to be able to control the ads

Any code contribution is welcome. Fork the code at github and send a pull request. This is the first application I've written in merb and the first time I've tried to use RSpec. Chances are that there's some better ways to do things, and I'd be happy to see how you handle them.
