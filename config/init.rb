### Uncomment for DataMapper ORM
# use_orm :datamapper

### Uncomment for ActiveRecord ORM
use_orm :activerecord

### Uncomment for Sequel ORM
# use_orm :sequel


### This defines which test framework the generators will use
### rspec is turned on by default

### Note that you need to install the merb_rspec if you want to ue
### rspec and merb_test_unit if you want to use test_unit. 
### merb_rspec is installed by default if you did gem install
### merb.
